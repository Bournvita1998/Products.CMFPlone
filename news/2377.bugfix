Do not include too new upgrades when upgrading Plone Site.
Otherwise the Plone Site ends up at a newer version that the filesystem code supports,
giving an error when upgrading, and resulting in possibly missed upgrades later.
Fixes `issue 2377 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/2377>`_.
